1. DESCRIPTION OF INPUT FILE VERSIONS

Note on composition calculation: it wasn't clear from Ignatiev's papers and references whether the right salt composition for the CR=1 mode was with ~70 mole% of LiF (arrived at by assuming fuel is added to 73 moles of LiF and 27 moles of BeF2) or with ~66% LiF (arrived at by setting the final fuel composition to 2% ThF4 and 1.2% TRUF3, and calculating LiF and BeF2 concentrations by mass conservation). Hence, both possible compositions were calculated and investigated:
~ 70% LiF composition: v2_1,2_3
~ 66% LiF composition: v2_2,2_4

See comments at the beginning of each input file for more details.

2. CONCLUSIONS
For the reactor to be critical with the fuel composition described by Ignatiev et al, the fuel salt density must be unrealistically high even though the starting estimate of the density is higher than expected for such a fuel salt, and the geometry described is very generous in terms of neutronics/leakage. Hence, the reactor cannot be critical with the given starting fuel composition.
For the reactor to be critical the TRUF3 concentration must be increased to at least 1.3 mole %

3. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK
The approximate model run could be further refined by adding the exact geometry and then calculating the new TRUF3 composition required to make the reactor critical.
To make the model more accurate, the exact fuel salt density and the physical properties of the structural component HN80MTY must be obtained. The data for the same has not been published by Ignatiev et al, and no one else except their research group has investigated this reactor.
The design of the distribution plate must be found, or deduced based on the optimized thermal hydraulics flow patterns discussed by Wang et al (2006)- Karlsruhe
