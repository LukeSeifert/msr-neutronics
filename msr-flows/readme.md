These scripts are used to analyze flows in MSRs.

### Short Term Testing

Testing to see the short term effects cycle time has upon msr behaviour, particularly looking at cyclical behaviour. These files are located in the `flow_tests` directory.

The `input.py` file contains the user defined terms (i.e. cycles and such).

The `complex_serpent_builder.py` and `serpent_builder.py` files contain the scripts used by `input.py` to build the Serpent inputs, where `complex_serpent_builder.py` uses a multiple core approach while `serpent_builder.py` uses a cyclic flow approach. Due to the Serpent bug in cyclic flows, the functionality of `serpent_builder.py` has been suppressed and it only sends flow through the core once. Additionally, the multiple core approach is not recommended due to the computational cost.

The `restart_serpent_builder.py` script uses Serpentâ€™s built-in restarting functionality to save material data and change flows in order to avoid the cyclic flow bug. It is fully functional, though some small updates are being made, which will be an additional option when running the code. This will be the option to have Serpent restart and write data after each step in order to allow for 100% of the material in each material region to flow, rather than the current approach used where only a percentage of the mass flows.

The `res_dep_analysis.py` file is used to analyze the results and depletion outputs, and is used to generate the plots.

To run these scripts, the sss2 executable is required. The input.py script is run, and the plots will be generated along with the various Serpent output files based on the user options selected.

The `./msr_cycle_test` directory contains all of the Serpent outputs as well as the generated plots.
